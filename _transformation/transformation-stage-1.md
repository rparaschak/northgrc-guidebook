## Intro

Transformation takes a lot of efforts and time and we need to tackle the most critical challenges. Our approach focuses
on 24 key capabilities across five major areas:

## Improvement Areas

We have developed a strategic plan for the first phase of our transformation journey. This initial phase focuses on
establishing the foundational capabilities that will enable subsequent improvements across all areas. The plan
prioritizes high-impact, achievable changes that create momentum for the broader transformation effort.

### Tests Automation

##### Test Development

Tests are developed together with features and executed in feature branches before merge and after merge to test branch.
Developers are responsible for developing, maintaining, and operating tests.

##### Existing Tests Migration

Existing tests will be gradually migrated by the frontend team with assistance from Illia under Andreea's coordination.
We will select only high-value tests to ensure we reduce each regression phase effectively.

### Frontend Improvements

##### TypeScript Integration

We are integrating TypeScript to improve quality and catch bugs at build time. New features are developed with
TypeScript only. When developing features, we also take time to cover code/features with strong types that are
dependencies to the feature. Our main goal is to cover API endpoints, Redux state, and components.

##### Linters

We take care of linters by initially eliminating all errors from ESLint and introducing new rules if needed. After that,
we enable linter checks on commit (using Husky or other tools) to ensure code with linter warnings cannot be committed.
TSLinter must also be implemented.

##### Module-based Project Structure

We are moving towards a module-based structure where features are encapsulated in single folders. Each module has UI,
API calls, and states. We introduce strict rules on code reuse and communication between modules. We expect this
approach to reduce dependency chaos. This structure also helps AI work with the code more efficiently.

### Processes

##### Breakdown Sessions

Before each feature, we hold breakdown sessions ([reference to process page](../processes/breakdown-sessions/)) with the
entire team to better understand the scope of work. During Q4, we improve this process to tailor it for team needs.

##### Peer Review

We run peer review for each pull request to improve quality of
work. [Reference to the process page](../processes/peer-review-process/).

##### Bi-Weekly Retrospectives

45-minute retrospectives to reflect on the current state of things with clear improvement tasks as output.

##### Pull-based Work

TBD

### AI Assistance

##### AI Code Review

Integrated agent into the workflow that checks code for bugs and runs acceptance criteria checks against Jira.

##### AI Coding Assistance

Training for the frontend team to start using AI Code Assist. Defining code parts that can be outsourced to AI Coding
Agent.
