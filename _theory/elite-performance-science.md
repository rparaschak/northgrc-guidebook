## Intro

**Elite software teams deploy code 2,555 times faster and recover from failures 2,604 times quicker than their low-performing counterparts.** This isn't hyperbole—it's hard science from the most rigorous study ever conducted on software delivery performance.

This presentation reveals breakthrough findings from "Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim—the **Shingo Institute Publication Award winner** and the research foundation behind Google's DORA program. What makes this study unprecedented is its scope and scientific rigor: **six years of data collection**, **32,000+ technology professionals surveyed**, and **23,000+ data points** analyzed across every industry and organization size—from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, non-profits to government agencies.

**The stakes couldn't be higher.** Organizations that fail to adopt these practices don't just underperform—they face **46x slower deployment cycles**, **dramatically higher failure rates**, and **significantly higher employee turnover**. Meanwhile, elite performers are **2x more likely to exceed their profitability goals** and dominate their markets.

**The revolutionary insight that changes everything:** There is no trade-off between speed and stability. Elite teams achieve both simultaneously, shattering the false choice that has held back the software industry for decades.

> Organizations often assume they must choose between speed and quality. Research proves this is a false dichotomy - elite teams excel at both simultaneously.

## Waterfall vs Agile: The Performance Reality

**The data is unambiguous: agile methodologies achieve a 40% success rate compared to waterfall's dismal 15%, while maintaining only a 10% failure rate versus waterfall's catastrophic 30%.** Waterfall projects consistently take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development begins, creating artificial constraints that ignore market reality. The speed difference is dramatic: agile teams capture market opportunities **46x faster** than waterfall competitors, making the choice between methodologies a question of business survival.

| **What Agile IS** ✅                                                                 | **What Agile IS NOT** ❌ |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Fast feedback loops** - Learning from customers in hours/days instead of months | ❌ **Having a scrum master** - Role-based thinking instead of team empowerment |
| ✅ **Painless pivots** - Evidence-based adaptation when requirements change | ❌ **Renaming roles** - Project managers becoming "product owners" without behavioral change |
| ✅ **Responding to change** - Flexibility over rigid plan adherence | ❌ **Ceremony compliance** - Meeting attendance over delivering working software |
| ✅ **Working software focus** - Functional product over comprehensive documentation | ❌ **Sprints in Jira** - Tool-focused approach expecting automatic transformation |
| ✅ **Empowered teams** - Self-organizing teams making technical decisions autonomously | ❌ **Process theater** - Following agile rituals without understanding principles |

**The core insight: Authentic agile is a philosophy centered on collaborate, deliver, reflect, improve.** It requires cultural transformation where teams are empowered to make decisions, experiment with solutions, and adapt based on evidence rather than hierarchy. The philosophy works because users are the ultimate fitness criteria for software, not internal stakeholders or predetermined requirements. The 24 capabilities that follow become the technical enablers that make true agile possible—you can't respond to change if deploying takes weeks, and you can't collaborate effectively if feedback loops are measured in months. Organizations that understand this connection achieve the **2x profitability advantage** and **49% focus on innovation** that separates elite performers from agile theater participants.

## The Four Metrics

The research identified four key metrics that reliably predict organizational performance:

- **Lead Time for Changes**: Measures the speed from code commit to production deployment
- **Deployment Frequency**: Tracks how often your team releases code to production  
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Captures how quickly you restore service after incidents
- **Change Failure Rate**: Indicates the quality and stability of your deployments. Change failures include deployments that require hotfixes, rollbacks, or patches to fix issues in production.

{: .block-tip }

These four metrics work together to drive both software delivery performance and broader organizational outcomes, creating a cascade effect from technical practices to business results and team well-being.

    A[Deployment Frequency] --> E[Throughput Performance]
    B[Lead Time for Changes] --> E
    C[Time to Restore Service] --> E

    D[Change Failure Rate] --> F[Stability Performance]
    G[Rework Rate] --> F

    H --> J[2.2x More Likely to<br/>Recommend Workplace]
    H --> K[40% Boost in<br/>Organizational Performance]
</div>

The research establishes clear performance benchmarks across four tiers, from elite performers achieving sub-hour lead times and multiple daily deployments to low performers operating on monthly cycles.

| **DORA Metric** | **Elite** | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | Multiple per day | Daily to weekly | Weekly to monthly | Monthly to bi-annually |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Less than 1 hour | 1 day to 1 week | 1 week to 1 month | 1-6 months |
| **Time to Restore Service** | Less than 1 hour | Less than 1 day | 1 day to 1 week | 1 week to 1 month |
| **Change Failure Rate** | 0-15% | 16-30% | 16-30% | 46-60% |


The performance gap between elite and low-performing teams is dramatic, with elite teams deploying **46x more frequently**, achieving **2,555x** faster lead times, and recovering from incidents **2,604x** faster while maintaining significantly **lower failure rates**.

## The 24 Capabilities

**These aren't just best practices—they're the scientifically validated drivers of extraordinary performance.** The research team analyzed thousands of organizations and discovered that these 24 capabilities work synergistically to create breakthrough results. **Elite teams don't excel at just one or two areas—they systematically build strength across all five categories.**

The power of these capabilities lies in their interconnection. **Teams that master continuous delivery practices see 5x improvement in lead times. Organizations with strong culture and lean management reduce burnout by 50% while doubling deployment frequency.** This isn't about picking your favorites—it's about understanding how technical practices, architecture decisions, process improvements, management approaches, and cultural transformation compound to create unprecedented results.

**The transformation is measurable and dramatic:** Organizations that implement these capabilities systematically move from deploying monthly to deploying multiple times per day, from weeks of recovery time to minutes, and from high-stress firefighting to predictable, sustainable delivery.

Research identified 24 specific capabilities that drive performance, organized into five categories:
