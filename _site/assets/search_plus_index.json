    "body": "“Does this new feature work and feel right?” Introduction A Peer Review is a crucial quality step that happens after the code is written, but before it gets formally tested or released. It’s an interactive session where an engineer gives a live demo of the new functionality to a peer. This isn’t a passive presentation; it’s a hands-on, exploratory session designed to answer this central question. Think of it as the first time the feature is seen through a fresh pair of eyes. While a Code Review checks that the code itself is well-written, secure, and efficient (e.g., no obvious mistakes like nested loops or excessive API calls), a Peer Review checks that the feature behaves as expected from a user’s perspective. The goal is to get fast, informal feedback and catch obvious bugs, performance issues, design inconsistencies, or confusing user experiences before the feature moves to the next stage. Key Benefits: Waste Prevention: Catch obvious bugs and UI issues early Testing Efficiency: Formal testing receives polished features Progress Transparency: Clear picture of actual completion status Knowledge Sharing: Spread functionality awareness across team Process Overview flowchart TD A[Feature Complete] --&gt; B[Request in #peer-review] B --&gt; C{Peer Available?} C --&gt;|Within 10min| D[Live Demo] C --&gt;|No Response within 10 min| E[Escalate] D --&gt; F[Exploratory Testing] F --&gt; G[Provide Verbal Feedback] G --&gt; G1[Provide Feedback in Jira] G1 --&gt; H{Issues Found?} H --&gt;|Yes| I[Move to In Progress] H --&gt;|No| J[Advance to Testing] I --&gt; A E --&gt; D Step by Step: Initiation Developer: Completes feature development and creates thread in #peer-review channel with feature details Peer: Responds with checkbox emoji (✅) or message under thread to claim the review Demo Developer: Walks through functionality in local environment, focusing on user experience, not code implementation details Peer: Observes and asks clarifying questions during demo Exploratory Testing Peer: Acts as inquisitive user testing the feature and asks “What if…” questions to explore edge cases Feedback Peer: Provides immediate verbal feedback during session Peer: Documents findings and feedback in Jira ticket comments Developer: Moves ticket to next stage or back to In Progress based on results Core Rules 10-minute response rule: Team goals over individual goals No shortcuts: Process cannot be bypassed Complete features only: Respect peers’ time Don’ts Being unprepared to demo: Developer should have the feature ready to demonstrate with proper test data and environment setup Peer not reading User Stories before joining the call: Peer should review the relevant User Stories and requirements beforehand to provide meaningful feedback FAQ Does peer review replace code review? No. Peer review complements code review - they serve different purposes. Code review checks implementation quality (security, efficiency, code standards), while peer review validates user experience and functionality. What comes first, peer review or code review? To simplify the process, it doesn’t matter. Can one person do both peer review and code review? Yes. The same person can perform both types of reviews, as long as they approach each with the appropriate mindset - technical implementation for code review, user experience for peer review."
